		Day 2 Notes Variables

Variables are used to contain/store data.

var - function scoped, can be re-declared, updated.

let - block scoped, can be re-assigned, updated, cant be redeclared.

const - block scoped, cannot be re-assigned, cant be re-declared, cant be updated.

var, let, const are called as specifiers. 

**Naming Convention:**

Variable name must have letters or digits[0-9].

Variable name can also have $, _

Variable name first character must not be start a digit.

No use of Reserved Key Words names as Variables .

Variables names are case sensitive

Ex: let name = ‘Balu’;

let $ = ‘dollar’;

let _ = ’underscore’;

let myname = ‘Balu’;

let Myname = ‘Balu’;

**Variable Name Standards:**

1. Use camelCase - means first letter starts with small letter, and second word first letter is in capital.
2. Human Readable.
3. The name should match the cause.

 

Ex:  let myName = ‘Balu’;

 

Syntax: 

let name= “Balu”;  → Value Assignment

name = “Krishna”;  → Value Updating

For Any Primitive values, the value is assigned means, is “Pass By Value”.

let fruit = “Mango”;

let vegetable = “Carrot”;

fruit = vegetable; → Carrot is assigned to fruit.

Left Side variable fruit is updated by Carrot 

Right side variable vegetable is same by containing Carrot.

**Primitive Data Types:**

1. String - sequence of characters - "Hello", 'A', "1234"
2. Number - numeric values - 123, 12.34
3. Boolean - true or false
4. Undefined - variable declared but not assigned a value. Ex let name, let salary;
5. Null - represents intentional absence of any object value. Ex let age = null;
6. BigInt - used for very large integers
7. Symbol - used to create unique identifiers for objects (Symbol('id'))

**Non-Primitive Data Types:**

1. objects - used to store collections of data and more complex entities.
2. arrays - used to store multiple values in a single variable.
3. Functions - block of code designed to perform a particular task.

**NOTE:**

Primitive Data type variables values are stored in Stack memory.

Non-Primitive Data type variables values are stored in Heap memory.

Whenever JAVA SCRIPT engine sees a line of code, it takes that line of code into 3 phases

1. Tokenizing/ Tokenization - Breaking a line of code into pieces/words.
2. Parsing - Java Script creates a tree structure with the tokens, it forms an ABS tree( Abstract Syntax tree). 
3. Interpretation - 
4. Generation code

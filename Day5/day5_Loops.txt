Loops
Used for doing is a task repeatedly. 

3 loops

For loop - Used when we know fixed number of iterations

While loop - Use when don’t know how many times to run. 

do while loop - Will run definitely one time without checking the condition. 

For loop - Used when we know how many times to repeat something.

for(initialization; condition; update)

{

//Block of Code

}

break : Its stops the execution and comes out from loop.

continue : Skip the particular iteration and rest will continue.

while loop : Used when we don't know how many times to repeat condition/something.

while(condition)
{
    //Code
}


do while loop : - Executes the block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true.


do{
    //code block to be executed
}
while(condition){
    //code block to be executed
}
